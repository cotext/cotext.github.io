								<strong>Philosophy</strong><br>

						In the introduction to his work, <i>Sermons in Accents; or Studies in the Hebrew Text</i>, John Adams gives a convicting challenge to Hebrew students, “to scorn delights, and live laborious days.”
						While struggling through difficult aspects of learning is commendable, one must consider whether the struggle is always necessary. This is the perspective on which Cotext is founded with an aim to make the study of Biblical languages a little less laborious, and perhaps even delightful.

The Term Cotext<br>
Halliday (2007 [1991]: 84):

Originally, the context meant the accompanying text, the wording that came before and after whatever was under attention. In the nineteenth century it was extended to things other than language, both concrete and abstract: the context of the building, the moral context of the day; but if you were talking about language, then it still referred to
the surrounding words, and it was only in modern linguistics that itcame to refer to the non-verbal environment in which language was used. When that had happened, it was Catford, I think, who suggested that we now needed another term to refer explicitly to the verbal environment; and he proposed the term “co-text”
